What is a Nutrient Report?

A Nutrient Report is a list of foods and their nutrient values for a set of specified nutrients. This API request provides similar functionality to the Nutrients List component of the NDB search application. Please take a look at this component if you are not familiar with it how it works by reviewing a report for protein.

How it Works

Each nutrient in the NDB is assigned a unique ID (nutrient_id). You must know this id to retrieve a nutrient report. A nutrient_id may be obtained by using the list API request. Please note that nutrient reports are only available for nutrients in the Standard Release (SR). Reports are not available for "speciality data" nutrients such as the bioactive compounds nor for foods in the Branded Food Products database.
Request Parameters

In addition to the api_key parameter, a request requires at least one nutrient_id in the nutrients parameter. Up to 20 nutrient_ids may be specified. Likewise, you may request up to 10 food group id's in the fg parameter.
Parameter	Required	Default	Description
api_key	y	n/a	Must be a data.gov registered API key
fg	n	""	limit your nutrients to one or more food groups by providing a list of food group ID's via the fg parameter. The default is a blank list meaning no food group filtering will be applied. Up to 10 food groups may be specified.
format1	n	JSON	Report format: xml or json
max	n	50	Number of rows to return. The maximum per request is 1,500.
offset	n	0	beginning row in the result set to begin
nbno	n	n/a	Report the nutrients for a single food identified by it's unique id -- nutrient number
nutrients	y	n/a	a list of up to a maximum of 20 nutrient_id's to include in the report
sort	n	f	Sort the list of foods by (f)ood name or nutrient (c)ontent. If you are requesting more than one nutrient and specifying sort = c then the first nutrient in your list is used for the content sort.
subset	n	0	You may indicate all the foods in the SR database or an abridged list from the pull down menu. Set the subset parameter to 1 for the abridged list of about 1,000 foods commonly consumed in the U.S. The default 0 for all of the foods in the database

1Format can also be sent in the request header: Content-Type: application/json or Content-Type:application/xml.
Response Elements

A response is structured as a list of one or more foods. Each food has list of one or more nutrients.
report	basic information about the report
	group	If applicable, the list of food groups used to filter the report
	subset	The name of the subset of foods in the response or all foods
	sr	Standard Release version of the data being reported
	end	The number of the last item in the reports -- normally start + max.
	start	Value of the offset parameter used in the report
	total	The total number of items available in the reports. Useful for paging the report.
foods	A list of foods
	ndbno	NDB food number
	name	food name
	measure 	The household measure represented by the nutrient value element
	nutrients	The list of nutrients and their values for a food
	nutrient_id	Nutrient Number
	nutrient	Description of the nutrient
	unit	Unit in which the nutrient value is expressed
	gm	The 100 gram equivalent value for the nutrient
	value	Value of the nutrient for this food
Some Examples

Here's some nutrient reports you can obtain for Total lipids (nutrient_id=204, ), calories (nutrient_id=208), carbohydrates (nutrient_id=205) and sugars (nutrient_id=269) in either XML or JSON.
