What is a Food Report Version 1? (Version 2)

A Food Report is a list of nutrients and their values in various portions for a specific food. The data elements returned in the API request match those in the Reports component of the NDB search application. Please take a look at this component if you are not familiar with it how it works by reviewing a report for chedder cheese. Reports are available in three formats: basic, full or statistics. A “Basic Report” contains a limited set of nutrients, based upon those found on a nutrition facts panel of a package of food, or frequently requested while a “Full Report” contains all the nutrients found in SR for that food. The "Statistics Report" provides all the statistical parameters available in SR. Additonal information on reports is available here.

Please note that reports for foods from the Branded Food Products database are only availalbe in a "basic" format. So, even though you may request a "Full" or "Statistics" report for Branded Food Products foods, you will only receive a "Basic" report.

How it Works

Each food in the NDB is assigned a unique ID called the NDB number (NDBno). You must know a food's NDBno to retrieve a report. If you don't know a food's NDBno you may use either the list or search API to obtain it.

Response Elements

A response can be lengthy but it's structure is relatively simple consisting of basic metadata for a food such as it's name, the food group to which belongs, scientific name and so on and a list of nutrients and nutrient values. For each nutrient in the list, some metadata is provided such as name and the unit in which it is measured and it's value expressed in 100g. Nutrients will also have a list of measures which are values of the nutrient at various portions, e.g. 1 cup. Measures vary by food and nutrient. Nutrients may also have a list of reference sources which are usually bibliographic citations in a non-standard format.
