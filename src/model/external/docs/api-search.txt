What are Searches?

A search request sends keyword queries and returns lists of foods which contain one or more of the keywords in the food description, scientific name, or commerical name fields. Search requests are a good way to locate NDB numbers (NDBno) for the reports API as well as for general discovery.
How it Works

There are no restrictions, other than common sense, on the keywords which can be searched. It's very easy to create paged browsing by using the total and offset (a zero-based start point) parameters. You may want to try the discovery application to get a feel for how searching works. You may limit your search results to a specific food group by specifying a food group id or a food group description in the fg parameter. (You may wish to use the list request to identify the food group id or description you wish to use.)
Parameters

The only required parameter for a valid search request is your authentication key (api_key). The default sort order of results list is "relevance", i.e. how closely a food matches the query terms.
Name	Required	Default	Description
api_key	y	n/a	Must be a data.gov registered API key
q	n	""	Search terms
ds	n	""	Data source. Must be either 'Branded Food Products' or 'Standard Reference'
fg	n	""	Food group ID
sort	n	r	Sort the results by food name (n) or by search relevance (r)
max	n	50	maximum rows to return
offset	n	0	beginning row in the result set to begin
format1	n	JSON 	results format: json or xml

1Format can also be sent in the request header: Content-Type: application/json or Content-Type:application/xml.
Response Elements

A search response consists of information about the results of the search such as the total hits matching the query and the starting and ending points in the results list, followed by a list of foods. Metadata for each food in the returned list includes the food's description (name) and NDBno.
